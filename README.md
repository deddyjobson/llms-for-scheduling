# llms-for-scheduling
a research topic for Investigating the Potential of Using Large Language Models for Scheduling.

## Abstract
The inaugural ACM International Conference on AI-powered Software introduced the AIware Challenge, prompting researchers to explore AI-driven tools for optimizing conference programs through constrained optimization. We investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for program scheduling, focusing on zero-shot learning and integer programming to measure paper similarity.
Our study reveals that LLMs, even under zero-shot settings, create reasonably good first drafts of conference schedules. When clustering papers, using only titles as LLM inputs produces results closer to human categorization than using titles and abstracts with TFIDF.
